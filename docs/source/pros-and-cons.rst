Pros & Cons of cldomain
=======================

Pros
----

* reStructured text format has flexible abstraction to extend its functionality.
  You can add new "roles" to support different types of documentation blocks.
* reStructured text is widely used. It is like markdown, but is more suitable
  for writing large interlinked documents.
* Sphinx provides builtin term search and also many other extensions are also
  `available <https://github.com/yoloseem/awesome-sphinxdoc>`_. And you can
  use all of them simultaneously. This can be especially useful if you are
  documenting the project which involves many programming languages.
* 


Cons
----

* Syntax is more complex than Markdown and requires some time to get familiar with.
* Syntax relies on indentation and sometimes it leads to the problems.
* Sometimes it hard to decrypt Sphinx's error messages when it doesnt do what you've expected.
* CLdomain is complex to setup. But you can use this repository as a skeleton :)
